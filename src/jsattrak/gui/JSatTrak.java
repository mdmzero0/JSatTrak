 *                              KNOWN ISSUE:  Stored satellites reference Name this may not be unique (and many cases it isn't)! Need to store it by NORAD ID or if a custom sat some other ID

 *          3.7.5 23 Mar 2009 -- Change 2D sun terminator resolution to 61 - 51 was reported by a user to cause some unwanted jumps as to which side was filled in, still has issues at times (even for higher res)
 *                               Integrated NASA World Wind Java V0.6 - plus a few new layers (like controls), redid some swing worker routines for thread safteyness
 *                               added substance look and feel (default Raven until Nimbus can work again),
 *                               fixed: saving of 2D coverage windows, 2D night light effects, and main app window location and size saved.
 *                               - 3D external windows now decorated to match look and feel (if avaiblilble)
 *                                   known issue: 3D internal window doesn't work with v0.6 (nimubs Look and feel only)
 *                                   known issue: webstart cannot save movies (no fix)
 *          3.7.6 24 Mar 2009 -- resize fix on 3D external window (in 3.7.5 they could only be made bigger) - set min size on globe panel (0,0) preferred size(50,50)

 *          3.7.8 26 May 2009 - bug fix, close app by file->exit doesn't close process - fixed (bug found by Horst Meyerdierks - SGP4 author)
 *          4.0  21 June 2009 - added sun shading effects in latest WWJ verion of the day. See posts:
 *                                    http://forum.worldwindcentral.com/showthread.php?t=21021&highlight=sun+shading
 *                                    http://patmurris.blogspot.com/2009/04/sunlight-package-for-worldwind-java.html
 *                                  (VOTD - WWJ Broke COLOR OF 3D ORBIT TRACE - fixed - disabled 2D textures in OrbitModelRenderable and EFEFModelRenderable)
 *                                  - Increased precision of GeoFunctions.GeodeticLLA
 *                                  - CORRECTED error in treating SGP4 data as MOD not TEME of date! fixed (and transformation to J2000.0 - found stk prob uses 24 terms in nutation calc)
 *                                  - CORRECTED error in using MOD position for LLA instead of TEME of date (corrected)
 *                                  - added name.gano.astro.coordinates.J2kCoordinateConversion for better coordinate transformations! (phase out old transformations)
 *                                  - now SGP4 prop matches STK very closely (~1m for ISS) and HPROP was compared as well and preformed just as well.
 *                                  - added smooth changes to the 3D view options
 *                                  - coordinate system selection for sat info dialog (J2k, TEME, MOD, TOD)
 *                                  - REPLACED SDP4 (GPL license, see references.txt) with my own coversion of CSSI's SGP4 propagator (name.gano.astro.propogators.sgp4_cssi) (ver: 3 Nov 2008) (same one used in STK 9.0)
 *                                     Note: the above change of SGP4 props and other changes in this release make the saved files from older versions not compatible! Files should now be smaller! (why it gets promoted to v4)
 *                                  - RELICENCED JSatTrak as LGPL!
 *                                  - FILE FORMAT: changes to use zip compression! files are now much smaller!
 *          4.1  10 July 2009    - added AutoClipBasicOrbit view for dynamic clipping plane calculations (23 June)
 *                               - ECI grid, and gui options for grid and clipping planes (moved from sim properties to each 3D window)
 *                               - fixed bug (that surfaced in v4.0) for using the autorun in the coverage tool - needed to make SGP4SatData.java serializable (9 July 2009)
 *                               - Added read ephemeris from file to Custom Satellite Builder (also ability to delete "ini conditions" and add ini conditions nodes (always to top)) (10 Junly 2009)
 *                               - fixed bug where null values were no cloned properly in CustomSatellite - creating exceptions in OrbitModelRenderable/ECI rendering layer
 *          4.1.1 21 Aug 2009    -  Added the current look and feel to the save file / and open file
 *                               - 31 Aug - fixed addSeconds in Time to avoid max integer problems
 *          4.1.2 26 Sep 2009    - special apache license version released for NASA / GSFC called ILIADS (Integrated Lunar Information Architecture for Decision Support)
 *          4.1.3 30 Mar 2010    - now can use startup.bsh script if found in root directory on startup (run locally) to config the opening scenario (for Pat M. of WWJ)
 *       
 *               Need to update to latest WWJ build - new view architecture
 *
 *          4.2   - in progress  TODO - fixes and ideas from: Christopher Suski
 *                                      - in the 3D window the sun shading terminator line doesn't wrap around the earth properly when the camera is set to follow an object rather than the earth
 *                                      - a viewport from the ground station to the sat
 *                                      - if you can make room on the Ground station browser button should probably be one the object list window
 *                                      Master Sargent:
 *                                      - add launch vechile
 *                                      - add missile
 *                                      - Radar "fence" for ground stations
 *                                      Jason Liu:
 *                                      - FIX:  handle case when SGP4 Propogator fails with an error code!!!!  use this TLE past Sept 14 2009 as an example to test with -- logg error in console
 *                                          H-2B R/B
                                            1 35818U 09048B   09257.12951375  .35140387  12869-4  28262-3 0   201

 *
 *                              Ideas for next versions: (no particular order)
 *                                  - Vectors tool (make them seperate objects) axis, grids, lines, arrows (data providers)
 *                                  - DATA out! - Reports and graphs and exporting of data out of program
 *                                  - 3D "Earth Night Lights" mask / 1/2 sphere transparent night shell
 *                                  - Add Objects (Abstract Satellites) like Moon, Sun, Panets maybe (can set view to center on them as well)?
 *                                  - Satellite Orbit Lifetime Estimator
 *                                  - Launch Vehicle "Simple Ascent" (or missile - Ballistic) 
 *                                  - Orbit Dertermination tool
 *                                  - track aircraft? (does this mean I need to rename the app?)
 *                                  - swath planning
 *                                  - dyanmic changing of clipping planes when in different viewing modes -- and Exponential zooming! (see my jogl 3d soloar system)
 *        
 */
// notes: not good to use rk78 in a solver loop because direvatives inaccurate, because solution changes slightly near end.?
//
// NOTE: in beanshell jar (i.e. bsh-2.0b4.jar) need to replace desktop.bsh, with one included with this source -- it allows bean shell desktop to be reopened
//       THIS BEANSHELL problem may be fixed in a newer version as I wrote the authore about this and gave him my solution

// 
// run from linux: add to VM Options
// -Djava.library.path="/home/sgano/Desktop/sgano/Java/Libraries/"
//
// To make jogl display correctly in Ubuntu Linux:
// sudo apt-get install driconf
// run driconf and set "Enable S3TC"
//
// =====================
// changes to WWJ to make internal windows work:
// http://forum.worldwindcentral.com/showthread.php?t=12360&highlight=WorldWindowGLJPanel
//  in (WorldWindowGLAutoDrawable.initDrawable()) comment line: this.drawable.setAutoSwapBufferMode(fals e); 
// TerrainProfileLayer:  -- works now my bug reports and fixes are in the release!
// - Fix clipping plane problem:
// in AbstractView.java (gov.nasa.worldwind.view)  --  change the code to this:
// private static final double MIN_FAR_CLIP_DISTANCE = 10000000000d;
// THIS SHOULD BE FIXED in WWJ >v0.4.1 (see: http://issues.worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/browse/WWJ-9)
//  I STILL WANT LIGHTING ADDED TO WWJ - SO I CAN SIMULATE sun/dark side of earth!!
//  - and also views for model centric views... but I think that will work in the next release too.
//
// Jar signing commands:
// NOTE: to unsign a jar (such as worldwind.jar) - open jar in winzip and delete everything in the meta-inf directory
//        then resign -- fixed issue with "web start complaining about jars signed with multiple keys)
